<!--- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Michael West is a sixth-year PhD Candidate in Mechanical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). His research seeks to better control algorithms for robots involved in rehabilitation, and dexterous manipulation. He has investigated human upper-limb motor control and human hand manipulation during tool-use and physical interaction. By introducing new methods of analyzing human motor control and exploiting old methods on new experimental paradigms, his work leads to new insights on human motor control and perception.

<!-- Michael is also a MIT Office of Graduate Education Diversity Fellowship recipient, a Ben Gold Fellowship recipient, Takeda Fellowship Recipient, an Alfred P. Sloan Scholar, GEM University Associate Fellow, and a Ford Foundation Fellow. In 2018, Michael received a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, from Yale University. In 2020, he received a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering from MIT. -->

Throughout his career, Michael has been a passionate volunteer and mentor for students from underrepresented backgrounds through his work in STEM teaching and mentoring programs. This includes but is not limited to his previous positions as President of the National Society of Black Engineers Yale Chapter, Treasurer of the Academy of Courageous Minority Engineers at MIT, Treasurer of the Black Graduate Student Association at MIT, Pod Leader for the MIT Summer Research Program, and Graduate Diversity Ambassador at MIT. In his free time, Michael enjoys playing sports, video games, card/board games, watching movies and television. In the future, Michael hopes to continue to support and guide students of all backgrounds, especially those underrepresented, towards STEM fields.
