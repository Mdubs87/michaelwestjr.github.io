<h3>Mechanical Impedance: A Necessity in Both Human Motor Action and Human Motor Perception</h3>
A research talk given to the Control Conclave at IIT Delhi on January 6th, 2023

Abstract: An understanding of the underlying control strategy employed by humans is required to develop technology that interacts with humans (e.g. prosthetics, exoskeletons, human-robot collaboration, and robotic rehabilitation). However, at the present time, both the robotics and motor control communities are far from complete comprehension. Understanding the coupled relation between human motor action and motor perception, we conducted a separate experiment in each domain to enhance our understanding of the latent human neuromotor controller. In the first, we falsified the assumption that humans can directly control force by showing that subjects could not regulate force independent of motion due to mechanical impedance. In the second, we showed that an aspect of mechanical impedance is encoded in human motor perception; furthermore, this observation was robust. Thus, we conclude that when modeling a system that incorporates human interaction, one should take special consideration of the humanâ€™s mechanical impedance.

<h3>Dynamic Primitives Limit Human Force Regulation During Motion </h3>
[Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9678084)

Abstract: Humans excel at physical interaction despite long feedback delays and low-bandwidth actuators. Yet little is known about how humans manage physical interaction. A quantitative understanding of how they do is critical for designing machines that can safely and effectively interact with humans, e.g. amputation prostheses, assistive exoskeletons, therapeutic rehabilitation robots, and physical human-robot collaboration. To facilitate applications, this understanding should be in the form of a simple mathematical model that not only describes humans' capabilities but also their limitations. In robotics, hybrid control allows simultaneous, independent control of both motion and force and it is often assumed that humans can modulate force independent of motion as well. This letter experimentally tested that assumption. Participants were asked to apply a constant 5 N force on a robot manipulandum that moved along an elliptical path. After initial improvement, force errors quickly plateaued, despite practice and visual feedback. Within-trial analyses revealed that force errors varied with position on the ellipse, rejecting the hypothesis that humans have independent control of force and motion. The findings are consistent with a feed-forward motion command composed of two primitive oscillations acting through mechanical impedance to evoke force.
