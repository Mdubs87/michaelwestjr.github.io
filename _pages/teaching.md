In the fall of 2020, I served as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the MIT Graduate level Course, [2.140 Advanced System Dynamics and Control](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m2a.html#2.140). Topics included analytical descriptions of state-determined dynamic physical systems, time and frequency domain representations, system characteristics, and modification of system characteristics using feedback.
In addition to working with Professor Neville Hogan to organize and develop lessons based on his teaching topics, I independently led students in weekly problem-solving based lectures. LLECTURE RECORDINGS AND NOTES WILL BE COMING SOON!

In spring 2021 I served as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the MIT Graduate level Course, [2.183J Biomechanics and Neural Control of Movement](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m2a.html#2.183). The class presented students with a quantitative description of how biomechanical and neural factors interact in human sensory-motor behavior. Topics included a review of relevant neural, muscular and skeletal physiology, neural feedback and "equilibrium-point" theories, co-contraction strategies, impedance control, kinematic redundancy, optimization, intermittency, contact tasks and tool use. As a TA, I assisted students in understanding homework and lecture material via weekly office hours, and I worked with Professor Neville Hogan to organize and develop lessons based on his teaching topics.
