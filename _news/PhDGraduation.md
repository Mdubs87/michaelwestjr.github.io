After 22 years of school and I’m finally #PhinisheD. I am immensely grateful to the many opportunities that have come my way. Thank you to everyone who has believed in me and rooted for me from both near and far; ya’ll are the real MVPs.

Here’s to a long life of learning and sharing that love of learning with others. Professor West coming soon!
