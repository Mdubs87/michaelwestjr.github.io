I went to the city of brotherly love (Philadelphia,PA) to participate in [the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2022](https://www.icra2022.org/). I presented both a poster and a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRfWe9KVSDY) titled ["Dynamic Primitives Limit Human Force Regulation during Motion"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9678084).
