I presented a poster on my paper titled "The Study of Complex Manipulation via Kinematic Hand Synergies: The Effects of Data Pre-Processing" at [Rehab Week](https://www.rehabweek.org/) 2023 in Singapore. RehabWeek is a well-established and highly reputable biennial conference that aims to cover inspiring innovations in Neurorehabilitation and their societal impacts. This year it was comprised of five different societies including the [International Consortium for Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR)](https://icorr-c.org/).

My paper was selected as one of the top 60 submissions across the 5 different societies and I was selected to give a one minute elevator pitch for my research. Finally, <strong>MY <a href="../../assets/pdf/The_Study_of_Complex_Manipulation_via_Kinematic_Hand_Synergies_The_Effects_of_Data_Pre-Processing_POSTER.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">POSTER</a> WAS SELEECTED AS ONE OF THE TOP 15 POSTER PRESENTATIONS!</strong>
