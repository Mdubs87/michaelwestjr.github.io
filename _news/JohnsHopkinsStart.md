 I am thrilled to be joining the [Haptics and Medical Robotics (HAMR) Laboratory](https://hamr.lcsr.jhu.edu/) under Prof. [Jeremy Brown](https://hamr.lcsr.jhu.edu/professor-jeremy-d-brown/) as a post-doctoral trainee at Johns Hopkins University. During my time here, my research will aim to enhance the understanding of haptic feedback during manipulation tasks and use this knowledge to improve robotic rehabilitation technologies.
