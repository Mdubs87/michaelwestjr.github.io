Check out this article by MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering (MechE) commenting on my recent experience conducting research in Munich at the Technical University of Munich: Check out the article here: [https://meche.mit.edu/news-media/meche-researchers-pioneer-human-motor-control-theory-through-global-collaboration-tu](https://meche.mit.edu/news-media/meche-researchers-pioneer-human-motor-control-theory-through-global-collaboration-tu)
