Through its program of fellowships, the Ford Foundation seeks to increase the diversity of the nationâ€™s college and university faculties by increasing their ethnic and racial diversity, to maximize the educational benefits of diversity, and to increase the number of professors who can and will use diversity as a resource for enriching the education of all students.
