Last week, I traveled to Heidelberg, Germany for the 10th IEEE International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics. While there, I presented my paper titled “The Study of Dexterous Hand Manipulation: A Synergy-Based Complexity Index” co-authored by Federico Tessari, Maggie Wang, and Neville Hogan. The paper presents and validates a new, unbiased metric to quantify manipulation complexity.

It was a wonderful experience to reconnect with old colleagues and meet some new. Moreover, I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the current state-of-the-art research. Our field is heading in some exciting directions!
