😊 I successfully defended my PhD thesis titled, "All Models Are Wrong, Simple Models Are Insightful: A Study of Human Manipulation." In it, I delved into the intricate world of human motor control and perception, exploring the role of simple models in unraveling the complexities of upper-limb motor control and hand manipulation.

🙏🏿 None of this would have been possible without the support and guidance of my advisor, Prof. Neville Hogan, my thesis committee, my many mentors, labmates, colleagues, family, friends, and the various organizations that have shaped my academic trajectory. Thank you all!

👏🏿 Thank you to everyone who has been part of this incredible journey. Your support, encouragement, and belief in my potential have been the driving force behind my success. I am excited to embark on the next chapter in my career! 🚀
