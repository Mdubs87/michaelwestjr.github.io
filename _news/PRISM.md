I visited Stanford as part of the Postdoctoral Recruitment Initiative in Science and Medicine (PRISM). While there I presented a talk titled "Exploring Human Performance: The Importance of Studying our Limitations" to both Allison Okamura's Research Group (the [Collaborative Haptics and Robotics in Medicine (CHARM) Lab](https://charm.stanford.edu/)) and Scott Delp's Research group (the [Neuromuscular Biomechanics Lab (NMBL)](https://nmbl.stanford.edu/)).
