My paper titled ["The Study of Complex Manipulation via Kinematic Hand Synergies:
The Effects of Data Pre-Processing"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304710) was accepted to the International Consortium for Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR). I will be presenting this work in Singapore in September 2023.
