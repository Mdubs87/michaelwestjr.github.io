I went to Chicago,IL to participate in the Society for Neuroscience conference. Along with my colleague [Meghan E. Huber](https://www.umass.edu/robotics/people/meghan-huber), I presented a poster titled Visual Perception of Stiffness from Multi-Joint Limb Motion. This work was the precursor to my paper titled ["Role of path information in visual perception of joint stiffness"](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010729).
