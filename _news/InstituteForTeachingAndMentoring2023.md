<b> The [Institute on Teaching and Mentoring](https://instituteonteachingandmentoring.org/) is the largest gathering of underrepresented minority Ph.D. scholars in the country.</b> The Institute offers workshops, recruitment events, and networking opportunities to support Ph.D. scholars in their professional development. It aims to equip them with effective tools for success in academia and other relevant fields. The goal is to foster a safe environment for scholars to share insights, build a supportive community, enhance research and teaching strategies, and develop skills applicable to their chosen professions.
